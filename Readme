Full-Stack CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions and Render

Overview

This project demonstrates a full-stack application with an integrated CI/CD pipeline that:
Runs Cypress component tests on Pull Requests to the develop branch
Automatically deploys to Render when code is merged to main

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
GitHub account
Render account (for deployment)
Node.js installed (for local development)
Basic understanding of Git workflows

Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Download
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
2. Install Dependencies
For both frontend and backend (if applicable):
bash
Copy
Download
npm install
3. Development Workflow
Create a new feature branch from develop:
bash
Copy
Download
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
Make your changes and commit them:
bash
Copy
Download
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
Push your branch to GitHub:
bash
Copy
Download
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
Create a Pull Request (PR) from your feature branch to develop

CI/CD Pipeline

Pull Request to Develop
When you create a PR to the develop branch:
GitHub Actions will automatically:
Set up the testing environment
Run Cypress component tests
Report test results in the PR checks
DO NOT MERGE if tests are failing.
Merge to Main
When your code is merged from develop to main:
GitHub Actions will automatically:
Build the production version of your application
Deploy to your Render service
Update your live application

Configuration

Required Environment Variables
Set these in your GitHub repository secrets (Settings > Secrets > Actions):
RENDER_API_KEY - Your Render API key
RENDER_SERVICE_ID - Your Render service ID
Render Setup
Create a new Web Service on Render
Connect it to your GitHub repository
Configure automatic deploys from the main branch

Testing Locally
To run Cypress tests locally before pushing:
bash
Copy
Download
npm run test
Or open the Cypress test runner:
bash
Copy
Download
npm run cypress:open
Troubleshooting
If GitHub Actions fail:
Check the Actions tab for detailed logs
Ensure all tests pass locally before pushing
Verify your environment variables are correctly set
If deployment fails:
Check Render logs
Verify the GitHub Action has proper permissions
Ensure your main branch builds successfully locally
